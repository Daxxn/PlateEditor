# PlateEditor

---

Airport Chart (Plate) editor. Only really useful with the [FlightPlanner Repo](https://github.com/Daxxn/FlightPlanner/) and the [AirportPlateParser Repo](https://github.com/Daxxn/AirportPlateParser/)

Also runs a bit slow at the moment. it does have to load and manage over **16k** png images after all.
